Machine Learning Concepts for Analysts

🔹 Lesson 1 – What Is Machine Learning (M.L.)?
==============================================
Summary:
Machine Learning helps computers learn patterns from past data instead of being explicitly programmed.
Supervised Learning → learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting prices).
Unsupervised Learning → finds hidden patterns (e.g., customer clusters).
Reinforcement Learning → learns by feedback (e.g., game-playing AIs).

Example:
Netflix learns your preferences by studying what you watch and recommends similar shows.

🔹 Lesson 2 – Supervised Learning Intuition
================================================
Summary:
Supervised Learning = “teacher-guided.” The algorithm sees inputs + known outputs and learns the relationship.
Regression → predict numbers (sales, temperature).
Classification → predict categories (spam / not spam).

Example:
Predicting house prices based on size, location, and rooms.

🔹 Lesson 3 – Unsupervised Learning Intuition
=================================================
Summary:
No labeled answers — the system groups or compresses data on its own.
Clustering → groups customers by behavior.
Dimensionality Reduction → simplifies complex data while keeping meaning.

Example:
E-commerce platforms cluster buyers by spending habits to personalize offers.

🔹 Lesson 4 – Overfitting & Underfitting
==========================================
Summary:
The balance between learning too much or too little.
Overfitting: model memorizes data, fails on new data.

Underfitting: model too simple, misses real patterns.

Example:
A student who memorizes past exam answers fails when new questions appear.

🔹 Lesson 5 – Machine Learning in Business Decision Making
===========================================================
Summary:
Businesses use M.L. insights to act smarter and faster.
Banking → fraud detection.
Healthcare → disease risk prediction.
Marketing → personalized campaigns.

Example:
An insurance company predicts claim probability to adjust premiums fairly.
